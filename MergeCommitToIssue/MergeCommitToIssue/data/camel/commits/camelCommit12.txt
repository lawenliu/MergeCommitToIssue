Maven plugins: m2e compatibility

 - Uses BuildContext to support m2e and improve user experience in Eclipse
  - Only trigger execution when input has changed
  - Notify eclipse of change of output
 - Only support the following goals in camel-package-maven-plugin (the others are not really meant to be used by non-Camel developers)
  - generate-components-list
  - generate-dataformats-list
  - generate-languages-list
  - prepare-components
