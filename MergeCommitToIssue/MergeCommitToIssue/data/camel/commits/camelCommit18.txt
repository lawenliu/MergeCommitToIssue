CAMEL-7080: Do NOT copy&paste the Oracle licensed code inside the JDK (which could end up with legal issues) but better make use of the Camel own utilities. Removed the obsolete catch block (as the method signature is 'throws Exception' anyway). Also moved closing the stream into a finally block to avoid code-duplication.
