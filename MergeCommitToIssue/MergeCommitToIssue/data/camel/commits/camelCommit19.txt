comments:
Generified the signature of the 2 ObjectHelper.notNull() methods so that ppl don't have to type cast the returned values anymore, e.g. Foo foo2 = ObjectHelper.notNull(foo1, name) where foo1 is of the type 'Foo'.  This public API change is binary backward compatible.

Better encourage users to make use of the provided "features.xml" of a given example which would spare the necessity to explicitly install dependency bundles/features of a given example through the user himself. In case of this example that would be the requirement to install the camel-spring feature beforehand as dependency. Also dragged down the note about log:display/log:tail into "Running inside OSGi container" section.
