CAMEL-9572: Validator: clearSchemaCache method refactored

- it is not a good idea to re-read the schema in the clearSchemaCache
method. Therefore the readSchema method is moved to the SchemaReader.
Now, if the schema was updated and the clearSchemaCache method is called
then the re-reading is tried during the first process call. This change
was especially necessary  to support the case where the schema document
was deleted and the clearSchemaCache was called. In this case. now no
error occurs during the clearSchemaCache call, but the error "no file
found" occurs during the next process call. This is the expected
behavior, in the previous solution the cache would not be cleared at all
and the processing would have went on.

Add Karaf 2.x, 3.x and 4.x instructions
btw you can use repo-add camel 2.16.1
and also for activemq
repo-add activemq 5.12.1

karaf knows a number of urls for known projects where camel and activemq is known. The same for karaf 2.x.

Thanks! I've just realised that while migrating the Karaf user guide to Asciidoc :) I try to learn more Camel awesomeness in the process ;)

I've included the change in #833.

CAMEL-9534: XmlConverter: use a pool of SAXParser / XMLReader instances

Creating and configuring a new SAXParserFactory and SAXParser / XMLReader
for every SAXSource is very expensive.

A SAXParser / XMLReader instance can be used to parse many XML documents.

Add an XMLReaderPool helper to manage existing XMLReader instances (i.e.
hand out existing instances from the pool, reset properties / features and
return the instance to the pool after use).

Use pooled XMLReaders in XmlConverter.toSAXSource* (except if a specific
SAXParserFactory is configured on the Exchange).

CAMEL-9534: optimize attribute handling in StAX2SAXSource adapter

Creating a copy of all attribute data for each START_ELEMENT event is not
necessary and wastes time and memory.

Use a custom SAX Attributes implementation that just forwards all calls to
the respective StAX XMLStreamReader.getAttribute* methods.

CAMEL-9534: XsltComponent: fix support for Saxon-B and Saxon >= 9.6

Using reflection and Saxon-specific APIs to configure Saxon's MessageWarner
class is flaky - the current implementation introduced with CAMEL-7753 only
works for Saxon-HE 9.3 - 9.5. Using XsltComponent with other Saxon versions
fails with IllegalStateException "Error pre-loading Saxon classes...".

Use TransformerFactory.setAttribute(FeatureKeys.MESSAGE_EMITTER_CLASS) to
install the MessageWarner class. Only log a warning on failure.

Make lazy-initialized factory variables volatile so that they only become
visible to other threads after the factory is fully initialized.

Note: The MessageWarner class in Saxon 9.6+ redirects <xsl:message> output
to the ErrorListener of the TransformerFactory rather than the Transformer
instance (see https://saxonica.plan.io/issues/2581). This cannot be easily
fixed on the Camel side, as setting a Transformer-specific ErrorListener on
the TransformerFactory would break multithreaded routes.

CAMEL-9534: XsltBuilder: always convert StAXSource to SAXSource

Some older TrAX implementations such as Xalan and Saxon-B do not support
StAXSource.

Using the Woodstox StAX parser with the default TrAX implementation (XSLTC)
doesn't handle CDATA sections correctly (Woodstox reports these as CDATA
events, which are ignored by XSLTC's StAXStream2SAX adapter).

Using StAXSource instead of SAXSource with the default TrAX implementation
(XSLTC) or Saxon results in a significant performance penalty.

Rename Camel's StaxSource adapter to StAX2SAXSource to better reflect what
it does. Use the adapter for all TrAX implementations (not just Xalan).

Fix sporadic test failures in camel-ssh and camel-ftp

In certain environments (in particular cloud environments), the unit
tests for camel-ssh and camel-ftp may quickly exhaust the Linux entropy
pool, causing slow test execution and sporadic failures. To solve this,
use /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random.

This problem has been observed on Google Compute Engine.

Fix erroneous logging when mapTemplate.size()==1

If mapTemplate.size()==1, the previous logic would still output the "Cannot determine which one to use" message.  Minor issue, but the structure of the internal if statements would leave room for silly logic errors if other code were inserted without thinking hard about all the logical combinations.

Polished and added camel-braintree to kit. This closes #756.
I guess this is wrong. Before it checked that the inBody is not present, so it requires an inBody to be present. According to the comment the above the inBody should never be present.

Well spotted, we can just remove that check as they other api components do not have such as check
