Producer no CQL Uri Param handling on doStart()

Problem:
- cql Uri param is not mandatory (default null)
- prepareStatements Uri param default true
Therefore creating a Producer like "cql://localhost/camel_ks" fails;
also, the error returned is misleading.

Details:
With the above premises, the top of the stacktrace is
"org.apache.camel.FailedToCreateProducerException: Failed to create
Producer for endpoint: Endpoint[cql://localhost/camel_ks]. Reason:
com.datastax.driver.core.exceptions.NoHostAvailableException: All
host(s) tried for query failed (tried: localhost/127.0.0.1:9042
(com.datastax.driver.core.TransportException: [localhost/127.0.0.1:9042]
Error writing))"
However this actually:
- is caused by the Producer doStart() trying to prepare a null cql
statement
- error looks like server/host is unreachable, but is actually the
failure of trying to prepare a null statement

Proposed solution:
Modify the the Producer's doStart() to invoke the Endpoint's
prepareStatement() method with additional condition that cql is not
null.
An additional unit test is provided to illustrate the scenario, for
instance a component earlier in the route would provide the actual cql
statement as part of the header, for example an EIP Translator.
Therefore in this scenario the cql is not unique and cannot be
configured in the Producer endpoint uri.

Aditional Notes:
On my machine maven test do fail on the master branch earlier than this
modification, and this modification does not solve those problems.

Added consumer, producer with event listeners, async and daemon solving features
Great stuff! :) Async solving is critical for enterprise use.

Shall I add something in the OptaPlanner release notes too about these improvements, so the OptaPlanner community is aware of these camel-optaplanner improvements?
  https://github.com/droolsjbpm/optaplanner-website/tree/master/download/releaseNotes

PS: bibryam if you 'd like your name on the optaplanner contributors list too, let me know:
  http://www.optaplanner.org/community/team.html

Yes and Yes

New component created for integration with jBPM
Interesting addition :)

Do note that drools & jbpm have some existing fuse integration (which is a bit hard to find because it's neither on droolsjbpm nor on fuse). IIRC, it was mostly written a few years ago, to replace drools-pipeline:
  https://github.com/jboss-integration/fuse-bxms-integ
There are some build issues with it since it moved GAV's etc, see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DROOLS-709 .

CAMEL-8857: camel-scr should publish the Camel to osgi so the karaf commands works and also what blueprint/spring-dm does.
@davsclaus Why do you remove camelContextId from OSGi provided property map?

Removing camelContextId before call to configure method seems to mean that member variable **camelContextId** is assigned with wrong/no value.

@davsclaus Context name must be set after call to configure method (sets member variables such as **camelContextId** with prefix support) and it should use the value of member variable **camelContextId** for the previous reason.

@davsclaus Does removing this mean that camel-scr bundle can no longer be used with older version of camel-core?

comments:
add VELOCITY_SUPPLEMENTAL_CONTEXT header

Add a header to specify a Map of supplementary variables to the
default velocity context entries.  Entries in this map will override
the default pre-defined values when using the same key, e.g. "body".

This provides a simpler way to pre-defined variables than providing
a custom context that completely replaces the default, while still
allowing values to be "returned" from the template via headers.
