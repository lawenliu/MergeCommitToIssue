8569 Ability to easily extract email attachments

Code + unit for feature request 8569-Ability to easily extract email attachments

Added an option to SplitAttachmentsExpression to have the attachments be split into
new messages with a byte[] body that contains the attachment, instead of a single
attachment on a clone of the message.

NOTE: Default behaviour is retained (i.e. splitting into cloned messages each with a
single attachment).

CAMEL-8332: Additional features for camel-dozer component

This commit includes the following changes:
* Added a new converter which allows the user to evaluate an expression using Camel language support and assign it to an output field.
* Enabled javax.el support to allow variables to be used in mappings.
* Users can specify the name of a DozerBeanMapperConfiguration bean instead of a Dozer mapping file to allow for fine-grained configuration of the Dozer environment.
* The sourceModel option is actually used now and targetModel is marked as required.

Adding ability to REQUEUE a message on RabbitMQ server instead of REJECTING message / sending it to DLQ.
@davsclaus Currently testing camel-rabbit 2.15-SNAPSHOT with a request reply pattern, I found a regression with the replyTo basicPublish. The body message sent on the AMQP channel is the message before processing the exchange. We would like the message after processing the exchange. The correction consist of copy the 187-193 lines at 203 line.

Thanks for spotting I am fixing this now, would be good if you could test again with the fix.

After testing, the fix is Ok. Thank you.

CAMEL-8226 Deprecated feature dataSourceRef not working correctly

If you try to create more than one of endpoint from SqlComponent with specifying dataSourceRef option, it doesn't remove dataSourceRef option from URL on 2nd attempt as dataSource object is already populated on 1st attempt, causes org.apache.camel.ResolveEndpointFailedException
